# General Guidelines

## Rules

### Documentation

- Every repo should contain an updated readme file.
  We expect the following sections in the Readme:

  1. Project description
  2. Installation: Explain how users can install or use your project locally on their computers. Include code snippets if necessary.
  3. Describe how to use your project, including code examples or screenshots.

### Language
- Everything commited in git should be in English. This includes all code, comments, documentation and more.

### Code
- Don't log sensitive data on info level. Add a debug statement next to it.
- Use descriptive naming of variables, functions and classes
- Separate source code from testing code in different folders
- Error messages should clear and should provide enough context to understand the issue.
- Use a logging framework.
- Make sure there are no obvious spelling mistakes in class and function names.
